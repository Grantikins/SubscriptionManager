# Subscription Manager

This is a full stack application that I created. It is a web app that helps users manage their subscription services. Users can provide many subscriptions and information about those subscriptions, 
and the app will store all of that data. It will keep track of the services, how much they cost, how much they have spent, when their payments are due, etc. This was another CRUD app that I made to learn a little more about full stack development. I refined a lot of what I already knew and pushed myself to learn more. 

The tech stack used here is:
* python
* HTML
* CSS
* javascript
* flask
* sqlalchemy
* sqllite 
* Spectre CSS

The full list of requirements is in the requirements.txt file here in this repo. You can install them if you want to run this on your machine. Here are the steps:

1) clone this repository
2) cd to where you cloned it
3) run "pip install -r requirements.txt" (This will download all dependencies)
4) run app.py
5) open the link in the command line or localhost on port 5000
