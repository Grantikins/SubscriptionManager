# Subscription Manager

This is a full stack application that I created. It is a web app that helps users manage their subscription services. Users can provide many subscriptions and information about those subscriptions, 
and the app will store all of that data. It will keep track of the services, how much they cost, how much they have spent, when their payments are due, etc. This was another CRUD app that I made to learn a little more about full stack development. I refined a lot of what I already knew and pushed myself to learn more. 

The tech stack used here is:
* python
* HTML
* CSS
* javascript
* flask
* sqlalchemy
* sqllite 

The full list of requirements is in the requirements.txt file here in this repo. You can install them if you want to run this on your machine.
